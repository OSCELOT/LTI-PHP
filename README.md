# LTI-PHP

## Description

This set of PHP classes encapsulates the code required by an LTI compliant tool provider to communicate with an LTI tool consumer.
It includes support for LTI 1.1 and the unofficial extensions to Basic LTI, as well as the registration process and services of LTI 1.2/2.0.
These classes are designed as an update to the LTI Tool Provider class library (http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/lti_tool_provider/) and
a replacement for the library at https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-Tool-Provider-Library-PHP which is no longer supported.

This site hosts a zip file which can be used to manually install each release; see below for access to the
documentation and source code files.
